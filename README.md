filetron - Facebook Messenger Online Queue Bot 
This GitHub project presents a Facebook Messenger bot designed for efficient online queue management. It offers a simple and intuitive interface for both administrators and end-users, significantly streamlining the process of managing and joining queues.

Key Features:
User-Friendly Interface for Customers: Users can easily join a queue, check their number and estimated service time, and receive notifications about their approaching turn directly within Facebook Messenger.

Simple Admin Panel: Administrators gain access to an easy-to-use interface for creating, editing, and managing queues. They can view the current queue status, call the next client, mark clients as served, or remove them from the queue.

Automated Notifications: The bot automatically sends notifications to users about changes in the queue, for instance, when their turn is nearing or when they are called.

Flexible Queue Customization: Ability to set up different types of queues for various services or departments.

Reports and Analytics (Potential): In the future, functionality for generating basic reports on queue load and service times might be implemented.
